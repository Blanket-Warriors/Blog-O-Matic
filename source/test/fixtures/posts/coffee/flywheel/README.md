- carrot bread cake thing good, filling
- $4.00 a cup
- vibe is relaxed; lots of people with children for sf coffee place
- Also lots of laptop people
- Baristas are super nice!
- lighter rock/pop/reggae kind of music.  Red hot chili peppers, bob marley kind of stuff.
- Have a roaster, wasnt running when i was here early.
- They know evwryone by name
- Hard walls, no acoustic panels.  It can prolly get loud with more people.
- guatemala: lighter, citrus-y fruitier, on the acidic side.  Smells that way too.  
- This coffee has an opinion, and tho i usially prefer less acidic coffees, i really appreciate this coffee’s zing and that it doesnt try to conform as much.
- Sumatra: still quite acidic, but this one is a little more mellow, sweeter, woodier.  It still has the punch of the guatemala, but it’s more balanced, like the guatemala was run through some blackberry bramble and picked up some forest vibes or something. It’s a bit more complex, and i like it, but its not quite as clean.
